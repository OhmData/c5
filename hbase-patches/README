We copied hbase sources at sha1 revision df641a4daf7f7c42e8193716233f562ee052e464

This directory contains patches from the HBase project since that
time.  Not all of them will be applicable to our project and those
will be moved into the 'skipped' subdirectory.

As new changes happen to HBase, we can generate additional patches using:
git format-patch --dirstat --stat --summary -M --start-number <number>  START..END

And copied into this directory.

Commits should reference the patches for ease of tracking.
